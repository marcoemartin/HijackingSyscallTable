The scripts testone and runone expect to find the code in ./<cdfid>/

runone - runs the students test_malloc against each of the traces in
the directory traces.  These traces include the two that students
had available.  These traces were used most heavily by the TAs during
grading.

testone - runs the auto-testing program in the directory auto.
This is a more sophisticated set of tests.  They are also harder
to understand as far as the output goes.  There were more single
thread traces in this set.
